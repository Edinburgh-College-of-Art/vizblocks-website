intro_text: VizBlocks is a dynamic data visualisation kit which offers public audiences new ways of physically representing data using a modular kit. With a range of materials, mechanisms and tools, VizBlocks can be used to translate data into playful and engaging physical data displays.

blocks_text: While you can use the VizBlocks system to build your own blocks, we have a number of pre-made blocks to get you started. You can play with these blocks out of the box in your next data visualisation project, extend their capabilities with new behaviours, or use them as examples to hack together your own custom VizBlocks!

Don't be afraid if it seems complicated, the toolkit is designed for beginners with a bunch of handy tools to help you get to grips with each component so you can start playing with data ASAP.
